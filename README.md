# Onyx-ArtificerPlus

- holding attack is now the same speed as spamming it (default: disabled)
- gave Artificer a weak hover when Jump is held 
- decreased tectonic surge cooldown and increased surge distance (default: disabled)
- localised sun now has different speed depending on if the special button is held
